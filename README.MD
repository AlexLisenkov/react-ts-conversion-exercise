# Convert React project to TypeScript

Example taken from: https://hackernoon.com/create-a-simple-todo-app-in-react-9bd29054566b

1. Convert the attached project to TypeScript. TypeScript can be used with and without Babel. For simplicity, remove babel from the project and setup TypeScript. But if desired, you can try to combine it (use`@babel/preset-typescript`). For now, just make sure the transpilation work, don't fix types yet, or convert files. Just show that the project can be run.
2. Fixes files and types one by one
2. Make sure the tests pass. 
3. TS is supported ootb with Jest, but together with ts-jest, tests will fail if they have type errors. Add `ts-jest`.
